# DS3
Homework for the subject "Discrete Structures 3" on University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics, contains various linear programming problems, solved in Python.

------------------------

# Running the algorithms

- adding new solutions

- Installation:
	1. Python3.7+
	2. Libraries/Dependencies:
		+ Numpy
		+ math
		+ copy
		+ os
		+ sys
		+ random
		+ queue
		+ collections - defaultdict

- Executing:
	+ python3 $(name_of_the_file.py)

	+ Follow the instructions given on the standard output.

- Inputs:
	+ Input formating is given during the runtime.
	+ I suggest using files, since it's been more tested, instead of manual input.
	+ Files should be saved in the folder "examples/", since the program is looking for a relative path to the file from that directory.
